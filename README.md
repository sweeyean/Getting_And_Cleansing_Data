###Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project
This is the course project for the Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera course. The R script, run_analysis.R, does the following:

1. Download the data set, https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip if it does not already exist in the working directory.
2. Unzip the data set into UCI HAR Dataset directory, if it does not already exist in eth working directory. You should see a folder named UCI HAR Dataset in the working directory.
3. Loads the activity and feature info and label teh datasets.
4. Loads both the training and test datasets, keeping only those columns which reflect a mean or standard deviation
5. Using the "merge" function, descriptive activity names are merged with the mean/std values dataset, to get one dataset with descriptive activity names
5. Merges the two datasets
6. Lastly, with the help of the "melt" and "dcast" functions of the "reshape2" package, the data is converted into a table containing mean values of all the included features, ordered by the activity name and the subject id.
The end result is written to the "tidy_dataset.txt" file.
